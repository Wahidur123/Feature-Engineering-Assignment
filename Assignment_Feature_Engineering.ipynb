It is responsible for updating the model's parameters (weights) based on the gradients of the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Types of Optimizers**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient Descent**:\n",
        "   - The simplest optimizer that updates the model weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.\n",
        "   - **Steps**:\n",
        "     1. Compute the gradient of the loss function.\n",
        "     2. Update weights in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If the slope of the loss function at a point is steep, the weights will be updated significantly. If it's shallow, the update will be small.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:\n",
        "   - A variant of gradient descent where instead of using the entire dataset to compute the gradient, a single data point (or a small batch) is used.\n",
        "   - This makes the process faster but introduces more noise, making it less stable.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In a dataset of 1000 points, instead of using all 1000 to calculate the gradient, SGD uses one randomly selected point for each update.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**:\n",
        "   - Combines both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent by using a small subset (mini-batch) of the data to compute the gradient and update the weights.\n",
        "   - This strikes a balance between the stability of batch gradient descent and the speed of SGD.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Instead of updating the weights using all data points or just one, you could update using 32 or 64 data points at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Momentum**:\n",
        "   - Improves upon gradient descent by adding a \"momentum\" term, which helps the model \"remember\" the previous weight updates. This reduces oscillations and can speed up convergence.\n",
        "   - The idea is that the model will move faster in the correct direction and overcome local minima.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Imagine pushing a ball down a hill, and the ball has some momentum—it will continue rolling even when the slope flattens, helping it get past small dips.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)**:\n",
        "   - An adaptive learning rate optimizer that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for that parameter.\n",
        "   - It prevents large updates and helps with convergence.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If a parameter has consistently large gradients, RMSprop will reduce the learning rate for that parameter, helping to stabilize the learning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**:\n",
        "   - Combines the advantages of both Momentum and RMSprop. It maintains two moving averages: one for the gradients (first moment) and one for the squared gradients (second moment).\n",
        "   - Adam is widely used because it is adaptive and works well for a wide range of problems.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In training a neural network, Adam dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter, speeding up convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Adagrad**:\n",

        "   - A more robust version of Adagrad that attempts to fix its problem of rapidly decreasing learning rates. It uses a window of accumulated past gradients to scale the learning rate.\n",

        "1. You load your dataset (e.g., features `X` and target `y`).\n",
        "2. Split the dataset, say 80% for training and 20% for testing.\n",

        "- **`train_test_split()`** helps you divide your dataset into a training set (for training the model) and a testing set (for evaluating the model).\n",
        "- It's an essential step in machine learning to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and does not overfit to the training set."
